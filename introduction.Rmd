## Timeseries

Time series data is pervasive. The idea of an evaporating time, amd recording a parameter of interest has been done since ages. We all keep record; a diary of events, car service records, timesheets, and so on. The analysis of any timestamped data (or a place holder for timestamp with an ordnal number) forms the premise for time series analysis.

## Show sample timeseries data
```{r }

```

## Plot

Sample timeseries plots emphasizing chaos, and later showing some structure or pattern to it.

```{echo=FALSE}
# plot()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
